  <p>
    Clicking the "login" button below will open a new window. This window will contain a login form that asks for your username and password. You can enter anything there, what's interesting is that after submitting the form, you will be sent to a page that should automatically close the window with `window.close()`. In iOS though the page's execution is paused when a "Save Password" prompt appears. Regardless of how you respond to the prompt, the page will be broken because it wasn't able to execute `window.close()`.
