  <button>Login</button>
  <p>
    Clicking the "login" button above will open a new window. This window will contain a login form that asks for your username and password. You can enter anything there, what's interesting is that after submitting the form, you will be sent to a page that should automatically close the window with `window.close()`. In iOS though the `window.close()` call is ignored when a "Save Password" or "Update Password" prompt appears.
